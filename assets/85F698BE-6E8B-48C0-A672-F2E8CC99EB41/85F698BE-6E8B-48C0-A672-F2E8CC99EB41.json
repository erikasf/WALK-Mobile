On the Trail Info pages it would be  even more helpful to the user if the trail’s current weath-  er conditions were displayed.

This forces the users to  always have location services turned on and depletes  their phone’s battery. In the App Store reviews, users  reported that the app is sometimes slow in responding  and that it closes suddenly. These bugs make the app  seem unreliable and may cause users to lose interest.","targetRectangle":{"y":481.64599609375,"x":685.7962646484375,"width":336.0773559510708,"height":363.6000037193298}},{"text":"The organization of the home page allows users to quick-  ly find trails that peak their interest.
