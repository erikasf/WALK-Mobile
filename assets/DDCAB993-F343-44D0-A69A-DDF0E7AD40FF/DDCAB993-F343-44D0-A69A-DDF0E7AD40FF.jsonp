It’s hard to  figure out where things are located and what they do. The  Menu and Hamburger menus seem to conflict with one  another and make it harder to figure out how to navigate  out of each page. The app offers a lot of options, but the  names on the buttons do not clearly explain what each  button actually does. The app would greatly benefit from  getting rid of the Menu button, simplifying their options,  and clarifying button names. These changes would pro-  vide clearer navigation and a less cluttered looking UI.","targetRectangle":{"y":364.6839904785156,"x":692.0247802734375,"width":338.6483398377895,"height":377.296003818512}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":540,"pointY":540},"width":1080,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":540,"pointY":540},"width":1080,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.0003500791246677598,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":540,"pointY":540},"width":1080,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"83B4D78A1AFB37D260819DFB7731DAAB"}]}]}}]}} )
