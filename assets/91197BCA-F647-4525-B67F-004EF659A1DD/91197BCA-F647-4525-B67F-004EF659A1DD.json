Trails are categorized within themes like Peaks,  Redwoods, Waterfalls, Wildflowers, Ocean Views, etc.  Users also have the option of searching for trails in an  interactive Map view when they click on the Google Maps  nav. This allows users to browse trails by theme or by map  view, which ultimately helps them narrow their search and  quickly find trails they like.","targetRectangle":{"y":252.4158325195312,"x":46.21099853515625,"width":279.640848048497,"height":590.6080060005188}},{"text":"cons","targetRectangle":{"y":652.5776610374451,"x":421.8578109741211,"width":85.26513671875,"height":50}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":540,"pointY":540},"width":1080,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":540,"pointY":540},"width":1080,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.0003500791246677598,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":540,"pointY":540},"width":1080,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":1080,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"F83B87D9200195E3E85D688EC1524DEC"}]}]}}]}
